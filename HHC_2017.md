# Holiday Hack Challenge 2017!

This is my writeup for the holiday hack
challenge 2017... Let's go!

## Question's

1. Visit the North Pole and Beyond at the 
Winter Wonder Landing Level to collect the 
first page of The Great Book using a giant snowball.
What is the title of that page?

Answer: About this book...

SHA1: 6dda7650725302f59ea42047206bd4ee5f928d19

2. Investigate the Letters to Santa application at
https://l2s.northpolechristmastown.com. What is the
topic of The Great Book page available in the web root of the
server? What is Alabaster Snowball's password?

Answer: The topic of the GreatBookPage2.pdf is about flying animals
like the flying monkeys of Oz and the flying reindeer of Santa
The password for Alabaster is stream_unhappy_buy_loss

SHA1: aa814d1c25455480942cb4106e6cde84be86fb30

3. The North Pole engineering team uses a Windows SMB server for

the Letters to Santa server, identify and enumerate the SMB
file-sharing server. What is the file server share name? 

Answer: Name of the share is FileStor

## Sn0wBallz

Well, what is there to say. I actually began
to like the snowball game but have to admit
it had me frustrated in the beginning, which is why
I did as much CranPi terminals before doing the game.

The more terminals you crack, the more usables you get
for deflecting the snowball to the end. really fun actually.

Yes, I did all the snowball quests.

## Terminals

### Winter Wonder Landing
To be honoust it took me a while before I 
figured out the mechanics of the snowball game.
So first I went with all terminals. first terminal
I took down was the one in the Winter Wonder Landing
level. 
The find command from the $PATH was the wrong one,
so just running "whereis find" shows us to run find
from /usr/bin/find and not /usr/local/bin/find.

```$ /usr/bin/find / -name elftalkd 2> /dev/null
/run/elftalk/bin/elftalkd <-- hello there! ;-P
```

### Winconceivable: The cliffs of Winsanity
We have to kill the 'santaslittlehelperd' process.

Reading up on the twitter of Sparkle Redberry
led me to believe that this had something to do with
aliases. Let's check the shell's .bashrc file.

```$ grep -i 'alias' .bashrc
alias kill='true'
alias killall='true'
alias pkill='true'
...
```

So yes, when we run kill we are actually running true,
which is not capable of killing processes... let's kill
the requested proces
```$ /bin/kill -9 $(pidof santaslittlehelperd)
```

### There's snow place like home
We need to run the trainstartup binary.

```$ file trainstartup
trainstartup: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, ARM, EABI5 ...\<snip\>...
```
Okay, it is an ARM 32 bit executable, but we are on x64.

```$ uname -p
x86_64
```

tab completion showed me that there is a full install of qemu.
Running 'qemu-arm trainstartup' gives us a nice ASCIImation and
completes the challenge.

### Cryokinetic Magic
I really liked this challenge, 
learned a very neat trick, thanks guys!

We have to run an executable in our home folder,
owned by root and no execute bit is set. Should be
simple enough, I copied the program and used chmod to set the
execute bit. It didn't work, another utility that has been
tampered with... 

Being clueless I went to the Twitter page of
the elf to look for hints and read some really cool blogpost
about using the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to trick a binary
in using your self defined functions. This didn't work here because 
we can't trace which functions the binary calls.

A post on superuser linked to by the twitter gave another great
technique; using ld-linux as an ELF interpreter. let's find this file.

```$ find / -name "ld-linux\*" 2>/dev/null
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

$ ls -l /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 Jun 16 20:57 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 -> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.23.so
```
Let's use that to run the executable

```$ /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.23.so $(pwd)/CandyCaneStriper
```

Nice ASCII art and done ;-D.

### Bumbles bounce
We have to find the least-popular browser by
checking an access log in the homefolder.

We can use awk to take a specific field (delimited
by spaces) and put that into sort and uniq to find the
browser given in the user agent that accessed the server.

Counting the fields shows that the 12th field contains
the name of the browser, so we will use awk to only print
this field, sort the output and use uniq with the -c switch
to prepend the count to the unique lines in the output.

```$ awk '{print $12}' < access.log | sort | uniq -c
    47 
      2 "(KHTML,
     90 "-"
      1 "Dillo/3.0.5"
      3 "GarlikCrawler/1.2
     34 "Googlebot-Image/1.0"
      3 "MobileSafari/604.1
    357 "Mozilla/4.0
  97534 "Mozilla/5.0
.....
```

Hmmm... the most used one is Mozilla/5.0, some of the least used
user agents aren't even webbrowsers but crawlers like Googlebot,
Twitterbot etc. But what is Dillo? Well, Dillo is the least popular
webbrowser it seems.

Maybe this is not the intended way, but it worked for me.

## l2s server

In the HTML source of https://l2s.northpolechristmastown.com we can
see a development page called dev.northpolechristmastown.com. going there
and using the hint from sparkle redberry we can see that we have to exploit
the orders.xhtml page. I used the tailored exploit from https://github.com/chrisjd20/cve-2017-9805.py
to place a php shell on the webroot. 

When connecting to my webshell I had a really hard time finding Alabasters password.
reading /etc/passwd gave me his username however: "alabaster_snowball".

After searching for longer than I want to admit I found out that
maybe he stored his password somewere in a development file from a tip
of one of the elves so I started to search in /opt/. Using 
```'find /opt/ -user alabaster_snowball -exec cat {} \;'
```
I found a lot of files belonging to alabaster, but nothing containing a password.

Lets grep the files

```$ cd /opt/ && grep -Hir 'alabaster_snowball'
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class:            final String username = "alabaster_snowball";
```
Okay, but i somehow cannot open the whole file, what about
setting some context to our grep output?

```$ cd /opt/ && grep -Hir -C 3 'alabaster_snowball'
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class-    public class Connect {
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class-            final String host = "localhost";
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class:            final String username = "alabaster_snowball";
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class-            final String password = "stream_unhappy_buy_loss";   
```

YAY! we got the password

## SMB through l2s server

For the next challenge we have to forward a local port to one
on the internal network through the SSH server.

First I ran an NMap scan in the internal 10.142.0.0/24 network
without ping to scan services within the network to find a host
with SMB on 10.142.0.7. Now we can use port forwarding through
SSH to connect to this fileshare.

```$ ssh -L 4455:10.142.0.7:445 alabaster_snowball@35.185.84.51
```

Then I used my Mac to connect to the fileshare on smb://127.0.0.1:4455
and logged in with alabaster's account to mount the FileStor share.
